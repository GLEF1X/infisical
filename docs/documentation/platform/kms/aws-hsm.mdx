You can configure your projects to use AWS CloudHSM for encryption, enhancing the security of your secrets. This guide will demonstrate the use of AWS CloudHSM as a custom key store for AWS KMS.

### Prepare AWS CloudHSM Cluster

The AWS CloudHSM cluster should meet the following criteria:

- The cluster must be active.
- The cluster must not be associated with any other AWS KMS custom key store.
- The cluster must be configured with private subnets in at least two Availability Zones in the Region.
- The security group for the cluster must include inbound rules and outbound rules that allow TCP traffic on ports 2223-2225
- The cluster must contain at least two active HSMs in different Availability Zones.

For more details on setting up your cluster, refer to the following [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keystore.html#before-keystore).

### Setup AWS KMS Custom Key Store

To setup an AWS KMS custom key store with AWS CloudHSM, you will need the following:

- The trust anchor certificate of your AWS CloudHSM cluster.
- A `kmsuser` user in the AWS CloudHSM cluster with the crypto-user role.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Key store creation page">
    Proceed to AWS KMS > AWS CloudHSM key stores and click **Create key store**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add key store name">
    Input custom key store name. ![Set key store
    name](../../../images/platform/kms/aws-hsm/create-key-store-name.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select HSM cluster">
    Select the AWS CloudHSM cluster. You should be able to select the cluster if
    it meets the required criteria. ![Set key store

  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload trust anchor certificate">
    Upload your CloudHSM's cluster trust anchor certificate file. ![Set key
    store cert](../../../images/platform/kms/aws-hsm/create-key-store-cert.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide cluster user password">
    Input the password of the `kmsuser` crypto-user in your cluster. ![Set key
    store
    password](../../../images/platform/kms/aws-hsm/create-key-store-password.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Finish key store creation">
    Proceed with creating the AWS CloudHSM key store.
  </Step>
</Steps>

For more details, refer to the following [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keystore.html#create-keystore-console).

### Create AWS KMS Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to AWS KMS key creation page">
    Proceed to AWS KMS > Customer managed keys and click Create.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set key options">
    Set Key type to **Symmetric** and Key usage to **Encrypt and decrypt**.
    ![Set key options

  </Step>
  <Step title="Select key material origin">
    In the advanced options, for the Key material origin field, select **AWS
    CloudHSM key store**. Click next. ![Set key options

  </Step>
  <Step title="Finish KMS key creation">
    Proceed with creating the AWS KMS Key.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Connect Infisical to AWS KMS Key

Now all that's left is to connect the AWS KMS key to your Infisical organization. Refer to the documentation [here](./aws-kms).
